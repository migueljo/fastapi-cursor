Best practices for using async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql

- Use asynchronous database operations to avoid blocking I/O.
- Implement connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper error handling and transaction management for database operations.
- Optimize queries by using appropriate indexing and avoiding unnecessary joins.
