Best practices for using SQLAlchemy 2.0 for ORM features

- Use declarative base for defining models and relationships.
- Implement asynchronous session management for non-blocking database operations.
- Use eager loading for related objects to reduce the number of queries.
- Implement proper transaction management and error handling.
- Use SQLAlchemy's query API for complex queries and avoid raw SQL where possible.
- Optimize performance by using bulk operations for inserts and updates.
